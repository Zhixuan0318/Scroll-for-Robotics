## 👊 Problem We're Tackling

Data centralization is one of the key issue when industries are operating their robotic automation in a web2-based infrastructure setup. Industries often adopt distributed manufacturing strategy which form a complex supply chain and involve various stakeholders and manufacturing units spreading in different locations. Hence, in a web2-based robotic infrastructure, each parties are actually siloed, as the data systems are disjoint, causing information asymmetry. In other words, A robot system in one factory may collect data that are not shared with robots in another factory, making it difficult to get a unified view of operations. The problems which arises will be:

#### ❌ Data is not Transparent: 

Factories and warehouses operating their robotic fleets in an isolated data systems or across various locations, will create a "visibility gap" that limits transparency and access to real-time operational data for stakeholders.
   
#### ❌ Low Efficiency + Track and Trace Challenge: 

Workflow efficiency suffers due to the complex data integration processes that slow decision-making and create operational bottlenecks. This lack of transparency also complicates essential tasks like tracking the history of production or the origin of raw materials, even among connected facilities. The underlying reason is the lack of clear auditing trials which can be easily access, and this is a classic problem in supply chain sector.
   
#### ❌ Security Concerns: 

Security concerns are heightened in Web2 environments, where mutable data is vulnerable to tampering and counterfeiting, which is considered a damage to the supply chain trust. Additionally, the risk of a single point of failure can lead to significant disruptions, cascading through the entire robotic automation operation.
